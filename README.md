Explanation:
HTML: Provides the structure of the web page with buttons for various actions and a container to display user information.
JavaScript:
Fetches random user data from https://randomuser.me/api/.
Includes functions to double the money, filter only millionaires, sort by richest, and calculate the total wealth.
Updates the DOM to reflect the data changes.
CSS: Styles the web page for a clean and modern look, with responsive buttons and layout.
This setup will allow you to add users, manipulate their money, filter for millionaires, sort by richest, and calculate total wealth, displaying all this information dynamically on the web page.
